# Overview

Welcome to the _ApolloFlow_ This ambitious undertaking aims to demonstrate proficiency in modern engineering concepts and tools centered around Go programming language, particularly focusing on harnessing the power of distributed computing to tackle challenging real-world problems.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this effort lies in addressing ever-growing needs for highly available, reliable, and flexible background processing systems. Leveraging Go and proven open-source technologies, we aspire to construct a versatile platform designed to meet diverse demands spanning industries ranging from finance to entertainment.

## Features

Some prominent characteristics of this project include:

- Scalable task distribution facilitated by RabbitMQ or Kafka message brokers
- Robust RESTful APIs powered by Go's net/http package
- Bi-Directional streaming gRPC notifications enabling seamless client interaction
- Resilience ensured through battle-tested approaches such as circuit breakers, failover mechanisms, and self-healing capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring instrumentation exposing actionable metrics for observability purposes

## Getting Started

These guidelines cover basic setup, toolchain installation, and dependency management.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you possess the latest releases of the following tools installed on your system prior to engaging in development activities:

- [Go](https://golang.org/) _(minimum v1.21)_
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) / [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) _(optional)_
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) _(if opting for database-driven persistence)_

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local workspace and navigate to its base directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/[username]/go-distribute-task-queue.git
$ cd go-distribute-task-queue
```

Initialize the Go module and acquire required dependencies:

```go
$ go mod init example.com/yourname/go-distribute-task-queue
$ go mod tidy
```

Configure environment variables by copying the `config.sample.env` file and renaming it to `config.env`. Populate placeholder values accordingly.

```bash
$ cp config.sample.env config.env
```

Launch the API server and worker(s):

```bash
$ go run cmd/api/main.go --port=8080
$ go run cmd/worker/main.go --broker=[amqp|kafka] --address=[broker_url]
```

### Usage

Refer to the exhaustive documentation accompanying each component detailing typical use cases and advanced options.

## Roadmap

Although currently in its infancy, this project harbors grand ambitions aimed at solidifying its position as a dependable cornerstone amidst burgeoning microservices landscapes. Planned enhancements include:

- Support for multi-tenancy isolation
- Fine-grained role-based access controls (RBAC)
- Advanced task prioritization schemes
- Event-driven, reactive architectural patterns
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines

Contributions welcome! Join hands in shaping this exciting venture.
